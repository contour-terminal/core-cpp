# Changelog

All notable changes to core-cpp are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the major version is 0, a minor
release may break the API; every break is listed under **Breaking** with a migration note. A
release tag `vX.Y.Z` equals the version in `project(core-cpp VERSION X.Y.Z)`, and the release
workflow refuses one without a section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The CMake framework: a module table that enforces the layering between modules, a dependency
  table resolved from the parent project, then `find_package`, then CPM, per-target toolchain
  tables (pedantic warnings, `CORE_CPP_WERROR`, sanitizers, coverage, clang-tidy), and no global
  state unless core-cpp is the top-level project.
- `core::testing` (Windows dialog suppression, usable without a test framework),
  `core::testing_dialogs` and `core::testing_main`, a Catch2 `main()` whose exit status is 0 when
  everything passed, 1 when anything failed or Catch2 reported an error, 77 when every test case
  skipped, and 2 when nothing ran.
- Configure, build, test and workflow presets for clang, GCC, AppleClang, MSVC and clang-cl, the
  sanitizers, clang-tidy, coverage and Tracy, and an `emscripten` preset for single-threaded
  WebAssembly whose tests run under node.
- Checks over the tree: the CMake and C++ hygiene rules with their self-test, the exit-code
  contract, and `tests/cmake/check-release.cmake`, which the release workflow runs on a tag.
- The documentation site, the API reference, the rulebook in `.agent/`, and the CI workflows.
- The module table's `PLATFORMS` column takes `any`, `native` or `wasm-subset`, and a module may
  list `SOURCES_EMSCRIPTEN`; `SOURCES_POSIX` is not compiled under Emscripten, which sets `UNIX`.
- `core::base` (namespace `core`): contract checks (`Require`, `Guarantee`), an injectable
  process environment (`core::Environment`, with `core::testing::FakeEnvironment` in
  `core::testing`), escaping, FNV hashing, type-safe `Flags`, `times()`, the password-database
  entry, string and range utilities, `Overloaded`, `Deferred`, Base64 (`core::base64`), the
  Tracy profiling macros (`CORE_ZONE_*`) and the `core::ranges::Iota`/`FoldLeft` seam. It owns the
  generated `core/Config.hpp`.
- `core::log`: categorised logging (`Category`, `Sink`, `configure()`), its sinks and formatters
  (`ScopedOutput`, `ScopedCapture`), and `fatal()` and `SoftRequire()`, which report through it.
- `core::cli`: the command-line parser (`core::cli::parse`, help and usage text) and the
  application scaffold `core::cli::App`.
- The Tracy dependency, 0.14.1 as contour pins it, resolved when `CORE_CPP_WITH_TRACY` is on:
  `core::base` then links `Tracy::TracyClient` and the `CORE_ZONE_*` macros record zones. A
  fetched client is built with `TRACY_ENABLE` and `TRACY_ONLY_LOCALHOST`. CI builds and tests the
  `clang-tracy` preset.
- `core::testing_main` applies the `LOG` environment variable to `core::log` before it runs the
  tests (`LOG=net` enables the `net` category and writes it to standard output), and so links
  `core::log`.
- `core::platform`, the operating-system layer: one clock seam merged from endo's, contour's and
  fastcached's (`IClock` with `now()` and a virtual no-op `refresh()`, `SteadyClock`,
  `CachedClock`, `ManualClock`, `IWallClock`, `SystemWallClock`, `ManualWallClock`,
  `WallClockRef`, `defaultSteadyClock()`, `defaultSystemWallClock()`), `Types` (`NativeHandle`,
  `isTerminal()`, ...), `PlatformError`, `Wakeup`, `SignalHandler`, `SystemPipe`, `WinsockInit`,
  `MessageQueue`, `FileSystem` and `NativeFileSystem`, `FileInfoProvider`, `EnvironmentProvider`,
  `UserPaths`, `PathUtils`, `GlobMatch`, `FileUri`, `SystemInfo` and `StringUtils`, with the test
  doubles `testing::InMemoryFileSystem`, `testing::MockFileInfoProvider` and
  `testing::TestEnvironmentProvider`, and `nativeEnvironmentProvider()` and
  `nativeFileInfoProvider()`, which give a composition root the private native implementations:
  Windows' own, and one POSIX provider each for Linux, macOS, the BSDs and Emscripten (endo's
  `LinuxFileInfoProvider`, which used nothing Linux-specific, is `PosixFileInfoProvider`).
  Under single-threaded Emscripten its row says
  `wasm-subset`: Types, PlatformError, Clock, StringUtils, PathUtils, GlobMatch, FileUri and the
  POSIX providers build, and their tests run under node.
- `core::coro`, header-only, with `core::coro::Generator<T>`: `std::generator` where the standard
  library has it and is not libstdc++, otherwise `core::coro::detail::GeneratorFallback<T>`, which
  is tested on every platform. fastcached's executors arrive with Task B1.
- `core::coro::StopToken`, `StopSource`, `StopCallback<F>` and the `constexpr` tag `NoStopState`
  (`<core/coro/StopToken.hpp>`): `std::stop_token`, `std::stop_source`, `std::stop_callback<F>`
  and `std::nostopstate` where the standard library defines `__cpp_lib_jthread`, and otherwise
  core-cpp's implementation with the standard semantics, which keeps plain state under
  single-threaded WebAssembly. libc++ 17 (emsdk 3.1.56) has `<stop_token>` only behind
  `-fexperimental-library`, and core-cpp adds no compile flag to its consumers.
  `CORE_CORO_FORCE_STOP_TOKEN_FALLBACK` selects the fallback everywhere; the test binary
  `core-cpp-coro-fallback-test` (ctest `core-cpp.coro-fallback`) is built with it, so the fallback
  is tested on every platform, ThreadSanitizer included.
- `core_cpp_add_test()` takes `NAME`, for a module's second test binary, and `DEFINITIONS`, the
  compile definitions of that binary alone.
- contour's coroutine vocabulary in `core::coro`: `Task<T>`, lazy and awaited once, whose promise
  carries the `StopToken` it inherits from the awaiting coroutine; `detail::UniqueCoroHandle`;
  `OperationCancelled` and `thisCoroStopToken()` (`Cancellation.hpp`); the `Awaiter` and
  `HasStopToken` concepts (`Awaitable.hpp`); `whenAll()`, which joins `Task<void>`s and rethrows the
  first failure once all have finished; and `whenAny()`, which resolves to the first to finish and
  cancels the others. Their tests also run over the `StopToken` fallback. A `Task`'s symmetric
  transfer is a tail call with Clang and MSVC at every optimisation level, with GCC only when it
  optimises sibling calls, and not in WebAssembly without `-mtail-call`. So awaits that complete
  synchronously grow the stack: at GCC `-O0` both a nested chain and a *loop* of 100000 of them
  overflow an 8 MiB stack, at GCC `-Og`/`-O1` the nested chain does, and under emsdk 3.1.56 the
  nested chain exceeds node's call stack. The deep-chain test is skipped under Emscripten without
  `-mtail-call` and for GCC without `__OPTIMIZE__`
  ([core-cpp#15](https://github.com/contour-terminal/core-cpp/issues/15)).
- `core::testing`: `ScopedTempDir`, `ScopedWorkingDirectory` and `EnvHelper` (`setTestEnv()`,
  `unsetTestEnv()`, `ScopedEnv`).
- `core::setProcessEnvironmentVariable()` and `core::unsetProcessEnvironmentVariable()` in
  `core::base`: the one writer of the process environment, in place of `setenv()`. On POSIX they
  publish a new `environ` block under `LiveEnvironment`'s lock and never free a published one, so
  a reader elsewhere never sees a block change or disappear under it.

### Fixed

- `core::nextPowerOfTwo()` rounds a 16-, 32- or 64-bit value up to a power of two. crispy's, which
  it was imported from, compared the type's width in bytes against bit counts and so smeared only
  the eight bits below the highest set one: 257 became 511, and 0x10001 became 0x1fe01.
- `core::LiveEnvironment` on Windows reads a variable set to the empty string as set, as it does
  on POSIX; it read as unset.
- `core::coro::Generator` is the same type in every translation unit. endo's, which it was
  imported from, tested `__cpp_lib_generator` before including anything, so whether it was
  `std::generator` depended on what the including file had included first, and a virtual function
  returning one (`FileSystem::walkDirectoryRecursive`) could have two return types in one program.
- `core::platform::SystemPipe` never blocks: both POSIX ends are non-blocking and close-on-exec,
  a write into a full channel reports done, and `send()` uses `MSG_NOSIGNAL`. endo's copy blocked;
  contour's, which an event loop's `post()` uses, already did this.
- `core::platform::SystemPipe::read()` returns a `ChannelResult`, which tells the bytes read, an
  empty channel and the end of the stream apart; only a failed read is a `PlatformError`. endo's
  and contour's copies returned a count, 0 for the end of the stream, and failed a read of an
  empty non-blocking channel with the same error as a broken one.
