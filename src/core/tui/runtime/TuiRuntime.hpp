/// `TuiRuntime` — the TUI's input semantics, composed on @c core::net::EventLoop.
///
/// **It is no longer a scheduler.** It used to be the second one in this project: its own ready
/// queue, its own timer heap, its own park slots, its own `pumpOnce`, driving its own blocking
/// `EventSource`. All of that is @c core::net::EventLoop's, and every one of this class's
/// scheduling members now forwards to it — `blockOn`, `spawn`, `delay`, `sleepUntil`,
/// `waitReadable`, `waitWritable`, the clock and the root stop source. Two schedulers meant two
/// answers to every question a scheduler answers, and the four defects this task closes
/// ([core-cpp#16](https://github.com/contour-terminal/core-cpp/issues/16) through
/// [#19](https://github.com/contour-terminal/core-cpp/issues/19)) were all in the second one's
/// answers.
///
/// What is genuinely the TUI's, and all that is left here, is **input semantics**: a decoded-event
/// buffer, the "next event / next event or timeout / next activity / next agent message" vocabulary
/// a terminal program is written in, and the interrupt policy. Those are not readiness questions,
/// so the loop has nothing to say about them.
///
/// **Its sources are parked flows, not entries in a hand-built wait set.** One flow per handle —
/// terminal input, resize, the interrupt wakeup, the POSIX signal fd — each parked on
/// `loop.waitReadable()` and each decoding only what it is for. That is what replaces the two
/// platform bodies of `TerminalEventSource` and the `#ifdef` in `PollEventSource`, and it is why
/// the Windows 64-handle cliff (core-cpp#19) is gone: the loop's Windows backend chunks its wait
/// set, and every backend does it the same way.
///
/// The agent-message wakeup is not one of them and has no handle at all. A worker with a message
/// calls `loop.post([&]{ runtime.notifyAgentReady(); })`, which is the loop's own cross-thread
/// surface — so the TUI no longer carries a wakeup object, a handle and a wait-set slot to say
/// what a post already says.
///
/// Threading: every member here is the loop thread's, exactly as the loop's own are. The one
/// cross-thread surface is @c core::net::EventLoop::post.
