/// `InputSource` — where the TUI runtime's input comes from, and nothing else.
///
/// This is what is left of the runtime's old `EventSource` once the waiting is the event loop's.
/// That interface was a *multiplexer*: it owned a blocking `wait(timeoutMs)`, folded terminal
/// input, resize, the agent and interrupt wakeups and an arbitrary fd registry into one native
/// wait set, and reported what it found. Every one of those jobs now belongs to
/// @c core::net::EventLoop, which does them for sockets and timers too — so what a terminal is
/// still uniquely able to answer is only this: **which handles become ready when there is input,
/// and what the bytes behind them decode to.**
///
/// The split is what makes the seam small enough to fake honestly. A test double for the old
/// interface had to impersonate a scheduler, so a case written against it proved things about the
/// double rather than about the runtime. Here readiness is scripted at the backend
/// (@c core::net::testing::ScriptedBackend) and decoding at this interface
/// (@c core::tui::runtime::testing::ScriptedInputSource), which are genuinely different concerns:
/// one is "the kernel says this handle is ready", the other is "those bytes are the letter k".
