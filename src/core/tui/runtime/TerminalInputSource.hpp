/// The production @c InputSource: a @c Terminal, seen as handles and a decode.
///
/// It is what `TerminalEventSource` became. That class was a multiplexer with two platform bodies
/// — `poll(2)` over stdin, the resize pipe, the agent wakeup, the interrupt wakeup, the signal fd
/// and a user fd registry on POSIX; `WaitForMultipleObjects` over the same set on Windows — and
/// **both are gone, not ported**: @c core::net::EventLoop already waits on handles, on every
/// platform, and does it without the 64-handle cliff the Windows body fell off
/// ([core-cpp#19](https://github.com/contour-terminal/core-cpp/issues/19)).
///
/// What is left has no platform body at all. Every question this answers, @c TerminalInput already
/// answers portably, so `core::tui` no longer has a single translation unit that picks its
/// platform with an `#ifdef` — the rule in `.agent/rules/platform.md` holds here by construction
/// rather than by review.
