/// **The listener is fine and the accepts are not**, which is the shape that ends an accept loop
/// that should have gone on: an `AcceptEx` completing with `WSAECONNRESET` because a client reset
/// its queued connection, or an `accept` answering `EMFILE` while descriptors are short. Neither can
/// be asked of a real kernel on demand. Each scripted failure is answered without touching the
/// decorated listener, so a connection a case opened beforehand is still queued behind it -- served
/// only by a loop that went on accepting.
///
/// It is the seam a consumer tests its own accept loop through: `posix/AcceptLoop.hpp`'s
/// `IAcceptCall` scripts the system call inside ONE accept, and is private to core-cpp.
///
/// **What it does not model:** a scripted failure resolves without suspending, where a real accept
/// that fails may have parked first. A loop over it that never yields spins its event loop, which is
/// what @c AcceptErrorPolicy::FailuresBeforeYield bounds; and a loop's behaviour WHILE an accept is
/// parked is not exercised by the scripted answers, only by the decorated listener's.
