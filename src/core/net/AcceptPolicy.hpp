/// What an accept loop does about an accept that failed: one answer for every accept loop, so that
/// none of them decides it by accident.
///
/// **A failed accept is almost never a failed LISTENER.** `AcceptEx` completes with `WSAECONNRESET`
/// when a client reset its connection while it was still queued, and POSIX `accept(2)` answers
/// `EMFILE` and `ENOBUFS` when the process or the system has run out of something. A loop that ends
/// on any of them leaves its listening socket open: the backlog fills, the kernel refuses every
/// later connect, and the port goes on showing `LISTENING` for as long as the process runs.
/// fastcached's compile node served nothing on its port for nine hours that way, while its health
/// endpoint answered `200`, and a flood of client resets reproduced it after 149 connections.
///
/// So only a listener that is closed or dead ends a loop. Everything else is accepted past:
/// silently when it is a listener's own poll deadline, with a rate-limited warning when one
/// connection failed, and after a bounded backoff when something is exhausted -- where accepting
/// again at once would only spin. A failure nothing classifies (`NetErrorCode::SystemError`) is
/// backed off on too, but only for so long: such an error may be permanent, and a loop must not
/// back off on a dead listener forever.
///
/// The policy is pure with respect to time and I/O: it decides, and the loop waits, logs and
/// accepts. `serve` (`HttpServer.hpp`) is one such loop.
///
/// Origin: fastcached `src/FastCache/Transport/AcceptPolicy.hpp`.
